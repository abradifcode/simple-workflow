## Introduction

This is the structure of Zell's personal sass-starter kit, built on a very simple workflow with Gulp. It allows you to compile Sass into CSS and reload the browser whenever you save a Scss file.

## Installation

Make sure you have Node.js installed. If not, go over to [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) to install Node. The version we're using in this starter kit is v6.5.0

You will also need to install Bower if you haven't done so yet.

```bash
$ npm install bower -g
```

On Mac machines, you might need an extra sudo keyword

```bash
$ sudo npm install bower -g
```

Next, download this repository. CD into it, and run the following commands:

```bash
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

## How to use

Begin writing your code by using this command:

```bash
$ gulp
```

`gulp` will start watching your Sass files and reload your browser from this point onwards.

Then, just edit your sass files that are found in the `scss` folder. Enjoy!
